## Test local

If you rather test the detector locally on your computer, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download or Clone the Repository

You can either download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using Git.

### Step 2: Extract the ZIP File (If Downloaded)

If you've downloaded the project as a ZIP file, extract its contents to a location of your choice on your computer.

### Step 3: Open the Project Folder

Navigate to the project folder using a file explorer or terminal.

### Step 4: Set Up the Web Server (Optional)

If you have a local development server (e.g., Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code), you can use it to serve the HTML files. Open the project folder in your code editor and start the server.

### Step 5: Open index.html

Open the index.html file in your code editor or a web browser. This page provides an introduction to the Pneumonia Detector and includes a button to go to the detector page.

### Step 6: Open detector.html

Navigate to the detector page by clicking the "Go to detector" button on the index page or directly open the detector.html file. This page contains the file input for uploading chest X-ray images and a button to detect pneumonia.

### Step 9: Upload an Image and Detect Pneumonia

On the detector.html page, click the "Select an image" button to upload a chest X-ray image. After selecting an image, click the "Detect pneumonia" button to run the machine learning model. The results, including the probability of pneumonia and a binary classification, will be displayed.

That's it! You've successfully set up and used the Pneumonia Detector project.
